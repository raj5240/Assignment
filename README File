1.# Trading Alerts Feature

## Overview
The Trading Alerts feature is designed to automatically detect and flag messages that contain specific trading-related keywords or signals. This helps users stay informed about potential trading opportunities or important market events.

## Features
- Detects trading-related keywords in messages.
- Scans multiple messages and identifies those that contain trading alerts.
- Configurable list of trading keywords.

### 1. Initialization
Create an instance of the `TradingAlert` class and we can optionally pass a list of trading keywords to the constructor. If no keywords are provided, a default list will be used.
alert_detector = TradingAlert()

2. Detect Trading Alert in a Single Message
   message = "I think the real crypto bullrun maybe starting now."
   is_alert = alert_detector.detect_alert(message)
   print(is_alert)  # Output: True

3. Scan Multiple Messages
    messages = [
    "❗️New users are restricted until they ➡️ CLICK HERE and pass the captcha or be kicked.",
    "I think the real crypto bullrun maybe starting now. See what happens over the next month or 2.",
    "If we breakout of this pattern, it requires a significant volume surge.",
    "Kraken allowed PayPal ser",
    "Do you see wyckoff on chart?",
    "The neckline held and we may see a reversal soon."
]
alert_messages = alert_detector.scan_messages(messages)
for idx, alert_message in alert_messages:
    print(f"Trading alert detected in message {idx}: {alert_message}")

4.Sample Input and Output

   messages = [
    "❗️New users are restricted until they ➡️ CLICK HERE and pass the captcha or be kicked.",
    "I think the real crypto bullrun maybe starting now. See what happens over the next month or 2.",
    "If we breakout of this pattern, it requires a significant volume surge.",
    "Kraken allowed PayPal ser",
    "Do you see wyckoff on chart?",
    "The neckline held and we may see a reversal soon."
]

alert_messages = alert_detector.scan_messages(messages)
for idx, alert_message in alert_messages:
    print(f"Trading alert detected in message {idx}: {alert_message}")

5. Sample Output

   Trading alert detected in message 1: I think the real crypto bullrun maybe starting now. See what happens over the next month or 2.
   Trading alert detected in message 2: If we breakout of this pattern, it requires a significant volume surge.
